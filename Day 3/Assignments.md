What is conditional rendering in React JS?   How to implement?
-- The method of rendering different elements and components based on conditions is referred to as conditional rendering.
-- This allows us to control the data displayed to the user.
-- Can be implemented using if-else statements, ternary operators, logical operators.
-- Example using if-else:
          class MyComponent extends React.Component{
          render(){
                  if(condition)
                  {return <div> Component A</div>;}
                  else
                  {return <div> Component B</div>;}
                  }
              }
